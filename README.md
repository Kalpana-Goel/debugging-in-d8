## First mention of bug and debugging
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- KG
- First reported bug in 1947
- Bug and debugging terms are attributed to Grace Hopper when she was working on computer at Harward University.
- Someone discovered moth stuck and stop the operation, she made a remark that they are debugging the system 
- and since then we are using that term.





## Debugging steps 
Note:
- Write tests so there are minimal chances of bug in your code
- if a bug does exist, reproduce a problem
- use debug in your code. In D7 - var_dump(), dpm
- find the source of the problem and fix it.

Note:
- If you see this sort of error (in my case long back while installing standard installation)
- doesn't give much information about error




## https://www.drupal.org/node/2313059
Note:
- No error shown by default
- NR would be great




## $config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'verbose';
Note:
- Add this in settings.php
- where?
